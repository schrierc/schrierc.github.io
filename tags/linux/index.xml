      <description>When upgrading from tmux 1.1 to 1.5 I found a few key bindings changed slightly. In particular, the arrow keys used to switch panes now repeat.
I often use the sequence C-b Down immediately followed by Up and then Enter to re-run a unit test. With 1.5 I was doing this too quickly (tmux&amp;rsquo;s repeat-time is 500ms by default) so I was switched back to my previous pane. To fix this I simply added the arrow keys to my .</description>
