      <title>Django templates: Accessing dict keys with colons</title>

      <description>Earlier this week I was updating a dashboard which uses Django templates. The data included a Python dictionary with a key that contains a colon: data:foo.
Normally the dictionary item is accessed using dotted notation such as {{ mydict.foo }} but using a colon results in a syntax error.
Exception Type: TemplateSyntaxError Exception Value: Could not parse the remainder: &amp;#39;:foo&amp;#39; from &amp;#39;mydict.data:foo&amp;#39; The simple fix is to change the key but I don&amp;rsquo;t own this object and it cannot be easily changed.</description>

      <description>When upgrading from tmux 1.1 to 1.5 I found a few key bindings changed slightly. In particular, the arrow keys used to switch panes now repeat.
I often use the sequence C-b Down immediately followed by Up and then Enter to re-run a unit test. With 1.5 I was doing this too quickly (tmux&amp;rsquo;s repeat-time is 500ms by default) so I was switched back to my previous pane. To fix this I simply added the arrow keys to my .</description>

      <title>Invalid tmux term causes irssi issues</title>

      <description>Today I finally switched my long-running IRC screen session to tmux. I rarely disconnect so I was simply waiting for a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; time.
After a few minutes I noticed that my irssi scrollback was misbehaving; only half of my window would redraw when I pressed PgUp of PgDn.
I had manually set TERM=xterm in my bashrc; however, tmux advises only using screen or screen-256color as the term. I have no idea why I had specified term within my bashrc; removing the line and restarting tmux corrected the issue.</description>

      <description>My favorite IRC client is irssi. I keep a log of my conversations using autolog; however, I dislike logs from chanserv, nickserv, and other random bots which I&amp;rsquo;ll never reference. I discovered that autolog has a setting to ignore them:
/set autolog_ignore_targets chanserv nickserv
While searching I also found log_create_mode; irssi&amp;rsquo;s default file mode is 0644. I prefer to keep my conversations private unless I specifically broaden permissions:
/set log_create_mode 0600</description>
